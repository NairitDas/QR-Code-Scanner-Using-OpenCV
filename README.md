# QR-Code-Scanner-Using-OpenCV
The code captures live video from the webcam and detects barcodes or QR codes in real-time. It converts each frame to grayscale for better detection, decodes the barcode data, and draws a green polygon around it. The decoded information is displayed on the frame and printed to the console. The program runs until 'q' is pressed.
